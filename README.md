PERFECTDATE.js
-
PerfectDate will take a date written any way and make it the perfect date. Your perfect date. 

Here's some examples:

>     perfectDate('20th of January, 2012', 'F d, Y')

will give you:

>     January 20, 2012

Now isn't that steaming hot?

Your formatting string can contain any of these cool selectors:

####Months
>     F m M n
####Days
>     d
####Year
>     Y y

There's plenty more to come, and I'm sure this'll grow into a perfect bunch of date helpers. Have fun!
